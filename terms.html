        <h3>Opening Statement</h3>
        <p>A-Dsctive is a digital product which gives the buyer access to a private Discord server - A free Discord account is required for this. Upon purchasing you are given access for 30 days, once these 30 days have passed you are then automatically billed for an additional 30 unless you cancel your subscription. You can cancel at any time by A) Logging into your User Dashboard and removing your billing details or B) By emailing <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9bf3fef7f7f4dbebfefaf8f3e2ebf2f5fce8b5f8f4f6">[email&#160;protected]</a> - Your request will be dealt with within 24 hours. Once a license key has been activated it is locked to the Discord account in which it has been activated on. We do not allow the license key to be moved to any other account, under any circumstances. Your A-Dctive subscription starts from the purchase date, and not the activation date. To get the most of your purchase we recommend activating immediately so you can utilise the first full 30 days before the next payment. If your A-Dctive license is paused, or your payment fails, you will be alerted via Discord so you can restart your membership/update your billing details - You will have 24 hours to do this otherwise your license key will be automatically destroyed, to regain access to A-Dctive you will need to purchase a fresh license key. We do not offer any refunds/returns due to our service being digital-based. We also do not offer support for any third party purchases except for BotBroker - We are not liable if you purchase A-Dctive via an unknown source. By purchasing you are accepting these conditions.</p>
    
        <p>
        All information collected from the checkout process are used to verify that your order is legitimate and is used via Stripe [Our payment processor] to enable us to run a subscription-based product.  A-Dctive Ltd reserve the right to terminate your membership at any time without refund. Inside the Discord server you will find a short list of rules which we require you to follow, these rules include basic requirements such as treating everyone with respect and not sharing information outside the group.
